# About
This repository holds the code for the "bag light" project at the Makerland 2014 hackathon.

# Bag Light
The bag light is like the light in your fridge - it turns on when you open your bag to help you look for things inside!

# How It Works
Using the components on hand, the bag light uses a IR proximity sensor to detect when the bag is open.
